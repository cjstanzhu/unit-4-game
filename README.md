# Crystals-Collectors-Game

Welcome to the Crystals Collector Game! Players will be given a random target number at the start of each round. There are four crystals to choose from. By clicking on a crystal players will add a specific amount of points to their total score. Players win the game by matching their total score to the target number. They lose the game if their total score goes above the target number. The value of each crystal is hidden until clicked on. Each time the game restarts, the values of each crystal will change. Click a crystal to play. Good luck!
